# Mortality Clock

You are not getting any younger! ⏳ Use your time wisely and take control of your life.

This web app displays your age as a float, inspired by the **memento mori** technique.

## Memento Mori:  
_"Remember that you will die."_ 💀

I built this website to serve as the **homepage** of my browser, reminding me every day to make the most of my time.

### What I learned:
- 💻 **React & CSS**: Practicing component rendering, conditional rendering, and styling.
- 🧠 **Local Storage**: Using the browser's local storage to persist data.
- 🌙 **Light/Dark Mode**: Reacting to and styling based on the user's system theme preference.

## Try it yourself
